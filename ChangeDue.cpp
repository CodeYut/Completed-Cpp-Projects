//1. Objective:  calculate change due in a transaction using these U.S. bills â€“ no cents: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1000, $5000, $10000, and $100000 bills.


//libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

//2. Requirements:
//
//--INPUT
//amountOwed = amount owed
//cashPaid = cash paid to balance

//--PROCESSING
//1. data definitions
//2. user introduction
//3. store input data from user (luckyNumber, favoriteMovie, userAge, firstLetter)
//4. output results
//
//--OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) :
//-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
//main program
